ChatSync is a real-time chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in both one-on-one and group chats. With user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), group creation, and user profile features powered by Socket.IO, ChatSync provides a seamless and secure messaging experience.

## Features
